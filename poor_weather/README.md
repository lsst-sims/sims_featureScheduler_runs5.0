Try running with very pessimistic weather downtime

Baseline has 28% of time closed due to weather

more pessimistic has 44% of time closed for weather.


also adding moredt.py for just adding 20 days of extra downtime in ~aug I guess.

As pretty much expected, closing for 44% of the time drops us down to 1.6 million visits. 

Having 20 days of downtime has a smaller impact. 

No major impact on survey uniformity for either.
