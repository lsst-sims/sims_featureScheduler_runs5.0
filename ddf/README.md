More DDF variations

from Saurabh:
ocean7: scaled down version, reducing the deep seasons from 180 days/110 epochs to 165 days/100 epochs
        (concept to get us down to 7% DDF budget for 2-snaps)
        released as ddf_ocean_ocean7_v4.3.5_10yrs.db
ocean8 (?): alternate concept for AGN
        shallow visits change from u:3 g:2 r:2 i:2 z:2 y:2 (ocean6) to u:4 g:2 r:2 i:3 z:3 y:3
        deep visits change from u:8 (ocean6) to u:12
        add accordion cadence on shallow seasons (half-cadence for first and last ~40 days) to get budget down
        not yet released: we will want feedback from AGN folks
